abstract = {{Due to advancements in product design and technology, products in the market today are capable of an extended life cycle by undergoing end-of-life treatments. To enable this, products have to be designed for multiple life cycle (MLC) purposes. Besides that, the presence of technology innovation has led to the generation of multiple products. Therefore, it is crucial to evaluate the life cycle of products in a wider scope. Currently, an existing method that approximately accommodates this objective is the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). However, the current LCA guidelines and standards are still insufficient to assess the environmental impacts of MLC products due to the limitation of the conventional LCA procedure, which only focuses on a single life cycle. Therefore, it is highly important to extend the current concept of the LCA to a Multi-Life Cycle Assessment (MLCA). It is possible for an MLCA to quantify the environmental impacts of MLC products and to evaluate the flow of materials among the generated products. To date, only two studies have explicitly mentioned the term ‘MLCA’, but both had different perspectives and methodologies. Moreover, previous LCA studies focused on evaluating the environmental performance of MLC products, such as remanufactured and recycled products. Therefore, this paper was aimed at proposing MLCA perspectives for assessing the environmental impacts on the MLC product system. To achieve this aim, a comprehensive and systematic review of previous LCA and MLCA studies that dealt with MLC problems was conducted. From the review, the knowledge gaps in the field of study were identified so as to contribute to an understanding of how the LCA can be extended to the MLCA for environmental sustainability.}},

abstract = {{Research into chemical recycling of plastic has increased over the last decade. At the same time, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology and application has developed and LCA continues to be an important tool for understanding the environmental impacts of materials and processes. LCA of chemical recycling processes is a growing area and this review gives a critical of the current research status. It is highlighted that there is confusion with nomenclature, with chemical recycling and feedstock recycling being used interchangeably to mean the processes of pyrolysis, gasification, hydrocracking or depolymerization of plastic waste. However, the two terms are rarely mentioned together. This causes inconsistency and a lack of visibility in the literature, confusion over term definitions and which term to use. Consequently, terminology use needs to be tightened. A critical analysis of nine chemical recycling LCA papers found that there are two approaches to modelling: a comparison of chemical recycling methods to other plastic waste management techniques, for example mechanical recycling, or the modelling of chemical recycling methods in combination with other plastic waste management methods, to treat mixed plastic waste. The direct comparison of chemical recycling methods and mechanical recycling is no longer valuable. Chemical recycling supports mechanical recycling by recycling plastic waste, which is not mechanically recycled, therefore there is no need to determine which method is best. Pyrolysis is the most researched chemical recycling method, as well as being the most common method modelled using LCA. Pyrolysis is often highlighted as the best chemical recycling method. It was concluded that there may be unintentional bias in these results due to more and higher quality data availability for pyrolysis. Therefore, further research on gasification, depolymerization and hydrocracking of plastic waste is needed to increase data availability and quality and enable better LCA modelling comparisons.}},
