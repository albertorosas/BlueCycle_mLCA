%TOPIC: About LCA is a methodology, and works perfectly to outlline the pros and cons of different methods
The Life Cycle Analysis, hereafter LCA, is a methodology aimed to provide a quantitative evaluation across, otherwise divergent, design choices.
Frequently used on the development of new services or technologies, it allows to compute the environmental impacts of disparate and several product systems.
Dating back to the 1960's, it has matured into a comprehensive decision-making tool which helps to establish a far-reaching perspective surrounding sustainability goals and ambitions.
Although predominantly related to the natural environment, it may be also tailored to include the accounting of social and economic effect while evaluating their plausible trade-offs.

%TOPIC: The LCA Languaje %FIGURE: LINEAR LIFE CYCLE
\autoref{fig:1} shows a schematic interpretation of the LCA approach.
It serves to illustrate the succeeding product stages and aims to instantiate some of the definitions typically used on the methodology.
Conventionally, a life cycle study would rely on reckoning a collection of various input and output streams which take part in the elaboration of any product (or service) since the extraction of materials in their natural environment up until the point it stops existing or it delivers its intended purpose (also known as functional unit).
Inside the methodology jargon, this collection is referred as inventory.
Inputs are subsequently distinguished into those in the form of materials, products or energy;
meanwhile, the specific outputs are referred as releases, co-products or waste.
The most common product stages are simplified in the figure.
Withal, inside of each of this stages are considered the several unit processes which are responsible of transforming the inputs into outputs.
Depicted in black, in between the stages, are the reference flows.
These are respective of a measure of those outputs from a process or stage which are required to continue into fulfilling the function of the functional unit.
Altogether, this collection of unit process and product flows in tandem with their interactions is considered a product system.

%TOPIC: About an mLCA
Although not always referred as multi-life cycle assessment, Suharinyanto et al.~\cite{Suhariyanto2017} demonstrated there has been an increased interest across literature on the development of life cycle analyses which include stages like remanufacturing, reusing and recycling inside their system boundaries.
This, exhibits a transition beyond single-life cycle approaches and widens the connotation of cradle-to-grave definitions into a cradle-to-cradle understanding.
That is not to say the idea of a mLCA is new.
Terms like LCA for remanufacturing or LCA for recycling are common across literature ~\cite{Simon2016, Woolridge2006}
However, these were most commonly regarded to products with low technological discontinuance, meaning they could easily be resold or be provided with a second life utilization (reused).
More complex aspects like market lifetime and product replacement have usually been neglected ~\cite{Suhariyanto2017}.
