\chapter{Goal \& Scope Definition}\label{ch:goalandscope}

%TOPIC: In this chapter
The main objective of this phase was to institute the specifics and outline the technicalities of the selected product systems.
An exact approach to be followed is determined.
In this chapter the initial choices which determined the working plan are explained.
Details on the terms of geographical and temporal coverage, the products, reference flows, functions, functional units and system boundaries are presented.
Alongside, a description on the target audience, motives and the intended applications is included.

\section*{Objective and motivation}
%TOPIC: Motivation
This LCA was aimed to bring precision on the environmental impacts undergone by disparate dispositions of synthetics polymers.
Specifically, this study was directed to thermoplastic polyolefins on the form of mixed waste streams.
In general, the main product system in comparison were mechanical and chemical recycling.
As it was appropriate, this research aimed to first calculate the effects across these two particular processing routes and then have them compared to the alternative.
Although the analysis procured to included the most relevant processes across the several product life stages, additional attention was granted to the extraction, production and disposal stages.

As previously mentioned, traditional multi-life cycle analyses leaned into reporting reuse and recycling practices almost indistinctly.
National legislation suggested a simplified approach in which

%TOPIC: Scope
%We will drop extraction and usage
% Spatial Limtations: Netherlands and only nerboring countries. We are leaving outside of scope alternatives that may treat the plastic in other continets or shit
% Time limit: One year in preference, but we will see.
% Technologies and health regulations are the ones imposed in europe.
% Fuels, electricity and heat emission will be considered from current Dutch national energy mix.
