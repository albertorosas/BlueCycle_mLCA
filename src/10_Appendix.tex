\item[Allocation] assigning the input or output flows of a process or Product System across/between the production systems being questioned.
\item[Ancilliary material] additional material used to produce the product. But is not part of the product.
\item[Category Endpoint] attribute of the natural environment, human health or resources which identifies a environmental issue of concern.
\item[Characterization Factor] multiplier used on the characterization model to convert and assigned LCI to the common unit of category indicators.
\item[Critical Review] process of checking against ISO standards.
\item[Cut-off criteria] specification on the amount of material, energy flow or environmental significance which is being excluded.
\item[Energy process] energy input required for operating the process or equipment at any unit process.
\item[Evaluation] a part of Interpretation which establishes confidence in the results.
\item[Feedstock energy] heat of combustion of raw material input that is \underline{not} used as an energy source to a product system.
\item[Functional Unit] quantified performance of a Product System for use a reference unit.
\item[Impact Category Indicator] quantifiable representation of impact category.
\item[Impact Category] class representing environmental issue of concern.
\item[Input] product, material or energy flow, that enters a unit process.
\item[Inventory] compilation and quantification of inputs and outputs for a product throughout its life-cycle.
\item[Life-Cycle]  consecutive and interlinked stages of a Product System.
\item[Output] product, material or energy flow, that exits a unit process.
\item[Process] interacting activities that transform input into output.
\item[Raw material] primary or secondary material used to produce a product.
\item[Releases] emission or discharges to water and soil.
\item[Sensitivity analysis] procedure to estimate the effects of choices made to the outcome.
\item[System Boundary]
\item[Uncertainty analysis]
\item[Unit Process] smallest element considered in the LCI for which you have input and output data quantified.
\item[Waste] material which is disposed.f criteria] specification on the amount of material, energy flow or environmental significance which is being excluded.\\

\item[FLOW]
\item[Elementary flow] material or energy entering or being released from the system without subsequent human transformation.
\item[Energy flow] same input or output in energy units.
\item[Intermediate flow] product, material, energy flow occurring between unit processes.
\item[Product flow] products entering or leaving the Product System.
\item[Reference flow] measure of outputs from a process required to fulfill the function of the functional unit.

\item[PRODUCT]
\item[Coproduct] any more product coming from the same unit process or product system.
\item[Intermediate Product] output from a unit process that is input of another and requires further transformation.
\item[Product System] collection of unit process and product flows, performing one or more defined functions, and which models the life cycle of a product.
\item[Product] any good or service.
