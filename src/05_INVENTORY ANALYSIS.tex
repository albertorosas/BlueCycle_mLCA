%TOPIC: GENERAL STATEMENT
This section describes the collection of data, together with their validation and a detailed description of the modelled unit processes.
Like so, an explanation and accounting of reference flows are provided.
Essential parameters and variables are introduced.

\section{Single Cycle}\label{sec:singleinventory}
%TOPIC: Intro to Single Loop
The modelling of a three-loop system required first to prepare the simulation of a single cycle.
By commencing with a single loop, it became possible to identify those unit processes with higher emission contributions and allowed for a process-specific balance of the mass flow.
As previously mentioned, starting conditions for all product systems were identical.
However, differences become apparent right after the sorting process.

%TOPIC: SORTING
The first unit process (SORTING) was represented as a market activity from the ecoinvent database.
This process, being a market activity, meant that its emissions were those which started at the gate of any activity labelled as 'waste polyethylene, for recycling, sorting.'
They regard not the chain of previously inquired emissions from the manufacturing, but it accounts only for those concerning the most recent sorting activity.
Although no additional distances were added to the original market activity, it already represents the consumption mix of the product in the given geography (Europe without Switzerland).
Output was set at 1 kg.

%TOPIC: GRINDING % OTHER %TABLE: INVENTORY EXTRACT
%Following SORTING came GRINDING \& OTHERS.
%From \autoref{tab:my-table1} is possible to inspect the most considerable input and outputs registered at the activity.
%A similar list was extracted for every unit process.
%All elementary flows were listed in each, and the numerical rules regarding their mass flow were detailed.
%For example, at \autoref{tab:my-table1} it can be recognized the fragment of output flow which is destined to incineration (PLAS INCINERATION) and the portion which is considered available to the subsequent process (PLAS).
%In this case, it was established a requirement of 1.18 PLAS input for every unit of product output (.64 PLAS INCINERATION + .36 PLAS)\cite{tech}. \footnote[1]{The name selected for flows has no greater impact on output calculation. The most important requirement is the establish the intended mass proportion between in and out every process}
%The data used at INCINERATION represents an average European waste-to-energy plant for the thermal treatment of municipal solid waste with typical technology used in Europe to meet the legal requirements.
%Environmental impacts regarding waste collection, transport or any pretreatment of the waste were not included.
%\autoref{fig:incineration} shows the logic behind INCINERATION inventory.

%TOPIC: Intro to the sankey. %FIGURE: MECHANICAL SANKEY DIAGRAM
%The continuing formulation of material balance across the multiple processes inside the product system results in the diffusion and reduction of main product streams.
%A visual representation of such is presented in \autoref{fig:7_sankey_mechanical}
%As can be seen, the total GRINDING product output accounts for the addition of the material lost in the process;
%the one sent to incineration and the one sent to recycling.
%(Endmost product flow can be seen in \autoref{tab:mechanicalintermediateflows})
%Similarly, a transformation occurs at every unit process, which typically reduces the original input in the case of recycling LCAs.
%The values used in this simulation (.8 and .2) are considered a typical representation of the technological limitations that mechanical recycling has over DKR 350 plastic streams.
%This process accounted for the elementary flows required for segregating, cleaning, sorting and grinding whole plastic pieces into smaller flakes.
%The grinding phase considered the usage of shredders and their electricity consumption.

%TOPIC: MOULDING AND THE CREDITING FORMULA %EQUATION: CREDITS
%Subsequently, the combination with a virgin material stream is mimicked at MOULDING.
%Here, the recyclable fraction from GRINDING is merged with a 75\% portion of virgin material.
%Regarding the awarded emissions, it is essential to consider that also at MOULDING, a credit for the avoided recycled product was implemented.
%That is, from the otherwise 100\% utilization of virgin material, the MECHANICAL product system receives credit on the scale of 25\% for the utilization of the recycled material.
%This crediting occurs aside from the embedded emissions incurred by processing the mentioned recycled product.
%\autoref{eq:equation} details on the mathematical expression.

%TOPIC: Description up to Pyrolysis
Like MECHANICAL, CHEMICAL's inventory began with the acquisition of 1,000 kg of DKR 350 plastic stream.
Similarly, losses are attributed to the GRINDING process (16\%).
However, the whole 84\% that remains is processed and sent to the pyrolytic reactor.
Replicated in the software, this is now the input for the innermost step of this product system.

%TOPIC: ABOUT PYROLISIS
The PYROLYSIS process involves the thermal decomposition of solid material in an inert atmosphere.
A change in chemical composition is induced by a specific and well-regulated increase in temperature.
Even if respective portions may change depending on the product input and operating conditions, an output of 10-20\% char, 30-40\% syngas and 50-70\% oil is expected.
As mentioned, heat is required to run the reactor;
however, it is possible to utilize this same synthetic gas output back into the furnace.
This intra-process recycled stream is modelled through a credit feature to the scale of the avoided material, in this case, of natural gas.
Quantitatively, it was estimated at 1.56 kWh per kg.
Solid waste (determined at 9\%) was sent to LANDFILL and accounted accordingly.

%TOPIC: SANKEY CHEMICAL %FIGURE: CHEMICAL SANKEY DIAGRAM
\autoref{fig:7_sankey_chemical} shows the Sankey diagram attributed to a single cycle of the CHEMICAL product system.
As can be seen, the initial product input is significantly broken down trough out the process.
CHEMICAL recycling may begin with 1,000 kg of DKR 350 and have that converted into 400 kg of recycled material without relying in additional material inputs.
Alike MECHANICAL recycling, this technology gets credited when replacing or avoiding the usage of any outer flow.
Highlighted in blue, \autoref{fig:7_sankey_chemical} showcases which of the product flow received a credit under the current modelling methodology.

%TOPIC: CRACKER and 2 TABLES  %TABLE: INVENTORY EXTRACT
The STEAM CRACKER process is required to produce shorter olefins from the liquid pyrolytic product.
The feed is diluted with steam and then led through a furnace, where it is heated to a high temperature (around 850 C) for a very short time.
Coal, crude oil and natural gas used for steam generation are modelled according to the region.
However, a credit is earned for the 20\% fraction of gas recovered during the cracking process.
\autoref{tab:my-tablecumbia} shows the issuance of this credit together with a excerpt from the additional elementary flow at the inventory.
15 and 65\% are the estimations used for the remaining gasoline and olefin product respectively

%TOPIC: LDPE PRODUCTION
Subsequently, LDPE PRODUCTION replicates the emissions incurred by polymerization.
After polymerization, the resulting polymer is fed into a hot melt extruder where some additives may be added.
Next comes underwater pelletization.
The resulting product is then dried and degassed.
The process began with a monomer and finished with a polymer pallet.
Energy consumption is included and considered coming from within European regions.

%TOPIC: EXTRUSION and COLLECTION
Finally, EXTRUSION and COLLECTION were modelled one after the other.
EXTRUSION considered both typical distances from producer to consumer and the extrusion process of plastic film, precisely that of blow moulding.
It was considered that 1 kg of this process would produce .976 kg of film product.
Further on, no reduction in mass was contemplated for COLLECTION.

%TOPIC: About the table %TABLE: Intermediate flow, CHEMICAL Recycling
\autoref{tab:C_MASSFLOW_1CYCLE} summarizes the intermediate flows generated at the CHEMICAL product system for a single recycling cycle.
As can be seen, just over 40\% of the original input material comes available for the next cycle and only a total of 162 kg are attributed to process losses.
It is worth noting that these streams may be slightly different according to diversity across process suppliers.
Additionally, specific mass quantities may vary based on varying efficiencies.
Product flows worthy of credit are also in view.
These are located at the bottom of the table as their aggregation results in negative values.
