\chapter{Inventory Analysis}\label{ch:inventoryanalysis}

%TOPIC: GENERAL STATEMENT ✔
This section describes the collection of data, together with their validation and a detailed description of the modelled unit processes.
Like so, an explanation and accounting of reference flows are provided.
Essential parameters and variables are introduced.


\section{Single Cycle}\label{sec:singleinventory}

%TOPIC: Intro to Single Loop ✔
The modelling of a three-loop system required first to prepare the simulation of a single cycle.
By commencing with a single loop, it became possible to identify those unit processes with higher emission contributions and allowed for a process-specific balance of the mass flow.
As previously mentioned, starting conditions for all product systems were identical.
However, differences become apparent right after the SORTING process.

%TOPIC: SORTING ✔
The first unit process (SORTING) was represented as a market activity from the ecoinvent database.
This process, being a market activity, meant that its emissions were those which started at the gate of any activity labelled as 'waste polyethylene, for recycling, sorting.'
They do not regard the chain of the previous emissions inquired from the manufacturing, but it accounts only for those concerning the most recent sorting activity.
Although no additional distances were added to the original market activity, it already represents the consumption mix of the product in the given geography (Europe without Switzerland).
Output was set at 1 kg.

%TOPIC: GRINDING % OTHER ✔
Following SORTING came GRINDING \& OTHERS.
Here, a 1.18 kg per kg input was considered.
This addition to material demand compensated for the process losses, reportedly ranging between 15 to 18\%.
In the same way, the remaining fraction is separated into INCINERATION (64\%) and MOULDING (36\%)
As discussed previously, this segregation relates to technological limitations associated with mechanical recycling.

%TOPIC: Abstract from MOULDING ✔ %TABLE: INVENTORY EXTRACT MOULDING
From \autoref{tab:my-tableBUYA} it is possible to inspect the most considerable input and outputs registered at the MOULDING process.
A similar list could be extracted for every unit process.
All elementary flows were listed in each, and the numerical rules regarding their mass flow were detailed.
For example, at \autoref{tab:my-tableBUYA}, the virgin and recycled material fractions used to manufacture the outcome product can be recognised.
A relationship of 1 to 1.78 (36\% recycled, 64\% virgin~\cite{waningen2020}) was established.
This part was critical for the material balance and the emissions accounted for mechanical recycling.
At this point, variations on the material composition could ament the resultant emissions and transform, for better or worse, the reprocessing capacity of this technology.

%TOPIC: INCINERATION ✔
The data used at INCINERATION represented the average waste-to-energy plant used for municipal solid waste.
This example would comply with all European legal requirements and considers the utilization of standard technology.
Environmental impacts regarding waste collection, transport or any waste pretreatment at INCINERATION were not included.

%TOPIC: Intro to the sankey. ✔ %FIGURE: MECHANICAL SANKEY DIAGRAM
As anticipated, the ensuing formulation of material balances across the multiple processes inmost to the product system resulted in the diffusion and reduction of main product streams.
A visual representation of such is presented in \autoref{fig:7_sankey_mechanical}
As can be seen, the total GRINDING product output accounts for the summation of the material lost in the process;
the one sent to incineration and the one sent to recycling.
(Endmost product flow can be read from \autoref{tab:mechanicalintermediateflows})
Similarly, a material transformation occurs in every unit process.
This out-turn is typical and would reduce product outcomes at recycling LCAs.

%TOPIC: The crediting system ✔ %TABLE: INTERMEDIATE FLOWs 1LOOP MECHANICAL
Also visible from \autoref{tab:my-tableBUYA} is the implementation of a credit mechanism.
The mark TRUE under 'avoided product' signals the software to discount the emissions related to that stream, hence the negative sign in \autoref{tab:mechanicalintermediateflows}.
The utilization of this crediting system replicates the avoided burden approach suggested by the governmental guidelines.
\autoref{tab:mechanicalintermediateflows} also enlists the resulting mass balance across the process based on the simulated input.
It can be noticed that under modelled conditions, the MECHANICAL product system finishes its processing with 85\% remaining from the original material input.

%TOPIC: Description up to Pyrolysis ✔
Like MECHANICAL, CHEMICAL's inventory began with the acquisition of 1,000 kg of DKR 350 plastic stream.
Similarly, losses are attributed to the GRINDING process (16\%).
However, the whole 84\% that remains is processed and sent to the pyrolytic reactor.
Replicated in the software, this is now the input for the innermost step of this product system.

%TOPIC: ABOUT PYROLISIS ✔
The PYROLYSIS process involves the thermal decomposition of solid material in an inert atmosphere.
A change in chemical composition is induced by a specific and well-regulated increase in temperature.
Even if respective portions may change depending on the product input and operating conditions, an output of 10-20\% char, 30-40\% syngas and 50-70\% oil is expected.
As mentioned, heat is required to run the reactor;
however, it is possible to utilize this same synthetic gas output back into the furnace.
This intra-process recycled stream is modelled through a credit feature to the scale of the avoided material, in this case, of natural gas.
Quantitatively, it was estimated at 1.56 kWh per kg.
Solid waste (determined at 9\%) was sent to LANDFILL and accounted accordingly.

%TOPIC: SANKEY CHEMICAL ✔ %FIGURE: CHEMICAL SANKEY DIAGRAM
\autoref{fig:7_sankey_chemical} shows the Sankey diagram attributed to a single cycle of the CHEMICAL product system.
As can be seen, the initial product input is significantly broken down trough out the process.
CHEMICAL recycling may begin with 1,000 kg of DKR 350 and have that converted into 400 kg of recycled material without relying in additional material inputs.
Alike MECHANICAL recycling, this technology gets credited when replacing or avoiding the usage of any outer flow.
Highlighted in blue, \autoref{fig:7_sankey_chemical} showcases which of the product flow received a credit under the current modelling methodology.

%TOPIC: CRACKER and 2 TABLES ✔ %TABLE: INVENTORY EXTRACT
The STEAM CRACKER process is required to produce shorter olefins from the liquid pyrolytic product.
The feed is diluted with steam and then led through a furnace, where it is heated to a high temperature (around 850 C) for a very short time.
Coal, crude oil and natural gas used for steam generation are modelled according to the region.
However, a credit is earned for the 20\% fraction of gas recovered during the cracking process.
\autoref{tab:my-tablecumbia} shows the issuance of this credit together with a excerpt from the additional elementary flow at the inventory.
15 and 65\% are the estimations used for the remaining gasoline and olefin product respectively

%TOPIC: LDPE PRODUCTION ✔
Subsequently, LDPE PRODUCTION replicates the emissions incurred by polymerization.
After polymerization, the resulting polymer is fed into a hot melt extruder where some additives may be added.
Next comes underwater pelletization.
The resulting product is then dried and degassed.
The process began with a monomer and finished with a polymer pallet.
Energy consumption is included and considered coming from within European regions.

%TOPIC: EXTRUSION and COLLECTION ✔
Finally, EXTRUSION and COLLECTION were modelled one after the other.
EXTRUSION considered both typical distances from producer to consumer and the extrusion processing of plastic film, especifically blow moulding.
It was considered that 1 kg of this process would produce .976 kg of film product.
Further on, no reduction in mass was contemplated for COLLECTION.

%TOPIC: About the table ✔ %TABLE: Intermediate flow, CHEMICAL Recycling
\autoref{tab:C_MASSFLOW_1CYCLE} summarizes the intermediate flows generated at the CHEMICAL product system for a single recycling cycle.
As can be seen, just over 40\% of the original input material comes available for the next cycle and only a total of 162 kg are attributed to process losses.
It is worth noting that these streams may be slightly different according to diversity across process suppliers.
Additionally, specific mass quantities may vary based on irregular efficiencies.
Product flows worthy of credit are also in view.
These are located at the bottom of the table as their aggregation results in negative values.

\section{Three Cycles}\label{sec:threeinventory}

%TOPIC: Intro to 3 Cycles. ✔
After single-cycle modelling, the simulation of a looped system became possible.
This expansion from a single recycling cycle was paramount for the fulfilment of the functional unit.
The following section explains the considerations contained in the looping and highlights its effects on the transformation of materials across the multi-life cycles.


\section*{Mechanical}\label{sec:mechanical3}

%FIGURE: MECHANICAL COMPUTATIONAL MODELING
\begin{figure}[H]{\textwidth}
   \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{Figures/DU_M_3Loops_OpenModel}
   \caption{Computational representation of multi cycle mechanical recycling}
   \label{fig:U_M_CompuModel}
\end{figure}

%TOPIC: About the Figure ✔ %FIGURE: MECHANICAL COMPUTATIONAL MODELING
As aforementioned, the computative recreation of a three-loop system was achieved by concatenating that of a single cycle.
\autoref{fig:U_M_CompuModel} shows this method attained inside OpenLCA software.
Three copies of the primary process sequences were connected one after the other at COLLECTION towards SORTING without considerable material losses.
\autoref{fig:U_M_CompuModel} also reinstates the ascription of the credits assigned at the MOULDING process for each of the cycles.

%TOPIC: About the total mass flow ✔ %TABLE: Mass FLow, 3 cycles, Mechanical Recycling
\autoref{tab:mechanicalintermediateflows3F}, at the very bottom, accounts for a total of 783.2 kg of avoided plastic material.
However, material-wise, these three iterations of mechanical recycling rely on the supply of 1,392.3 virgin materials.
That is almost as double what it initially "avoided".

\section*{Chemical}\label{sec:chemical3}

%FIGURE: CHEMICAL COMPUTATIONAL MODELING
\begin{figure}[H]{\textwidth}
   \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{Figures/DU_C_3Loops_OpenModel}
   \caption{Computational representation of multi cycle chemical recycling}
   \label{fig:U_C_CompuModel}
\end{figure}

%TOPIC: CHEMICAL is the best ✔ %FIGURE: CHEMICAL COMPUTATIONAL MODEL %TABLE: INTERMEDIATE FLWO AT # LOOPS
Similar to the MECHANICAL, the CHEMICAL three-loop simulation connected the last process of the previous cycle to the first one of the next.
A direct one-to-one ratio was considered.
It is relevant to remember that an assumption was made indicating that this plastic may not very specifically be the same.
These inter-cycle connections aim to model the conservancy of the mass, even if, in reality, the material is anew.
As evident from \autoref{fig:U_C_CompuModel} a more significant amount of product flows are attributed to this technology.
Whether in units of energy or mass, chemical recycling accomplishes a more excellent retrieval of material attributes.
Overall, and reckoned at \autoref{tab:chemicalintermediateflows3F}, CHEMICAL recycling does a better job of reclaiming and achieving the substitution of fresh materials.
